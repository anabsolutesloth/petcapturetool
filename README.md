## Portable Pet Sphere
a Simple mod adding an item to carry around your Pets and other Tamed creatures!

- By default, can capture any Entity that is considered "Ownable", as long as the player trying to capture it is its Owner.
  - Can also capture Foxes that trust the player. (Configurable, default: true)
- Tooltip shows instructions for use, and the contained Entity. (if there is one) 
- Entity Type tags for entities that can *ALWAYS* be captured (even if they have no Owner), or can *NEVER* be captured. (even if you are their Owner)
- "Navigation Override" config system, where an Entity can be assigned a path to take to reach its Owner tag, in the case it is unconventional.
